Monitoring Planned: Brightwater will develop a stability monitoring program by establishing monuments for annual surveys of cross sections and a thalweg profile. Stability monitoring will also include annual pebble counts to monitor particle size distribution of materials in bed and banks. Brightwater will prepare an annual report of the results of this monitoring. The Maryland Fisheries Service, a partner in this project, will conduct annual aquatic life surveys to document the condition of the biological community in the restored reach. The biological monitoring effort will include fish and macroinvertebrates. ",
